# Motorola Devices

## Disclaimer
I only support devices I own. Do not create issues if you are using any other type of config other than what I've listed. 

*DO NOT CREATE ISSUES ASKING FOR ETA, SUPPORTING ANOTHER MODEL, OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. YOU WILL NOT LIKE MY RESPONSE. READING IS FUNDEMENTAL. I WILL ONLY SUPPORT A DEVICE THAT I OWN. I WILL NOT GIVE ETAS. I DO NOT NEED TESTERS.* 

## Issue Template:

 - Detailed description of what's happening (Saying calls don't work or phone won't turn on doesn't tell me a thing. I need a detailed description of the issue.)
 - Screenshot if possible
 - Logcat (DO NOT PASTE LOGCAT IN ISSUE. USE PASTEBIN OR OTHERS AND PASTE LINK IN ISSUE).
 - Build Number
